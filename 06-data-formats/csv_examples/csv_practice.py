üéØ CSV Practice - Master Spreadsheet Data!

Your mission: Learn to work with CSV files, the universal format for device inventories, 
reports, and bulk data operations that work perfectly with Excel!

üî• What makes this exciting?
- CSV works with every spreadsheet program
- Perfect for device inventories and reports
- Super fast to read and write
- Great for bulk network operations

üìö Study the main README first to understand CSV basics!

üí° Pro Tip: CSV is like a simple table - rows and columns separated by commas.
