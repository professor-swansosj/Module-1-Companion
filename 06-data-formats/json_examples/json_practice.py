🎯 JSON Practice - Master Network API Data!

Your mission: Learn to work with JSON, the language of modern network APIs.
Every network controller, REST API, and automation tool speaks JSON!

🔥 What makes this exciting?
- JSON is everywhere in modern networking
- APIs return JSON responses 
- Network controllers use JSON for configuration
- Automation tools love JSON data

📚 Study the main README first to understand JSON basics!

💡 Pro Tip: JSON looks like Python dictionaries and lists with quotes around everything.
